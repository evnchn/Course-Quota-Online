It is based on the understanding that cells, genetic networks, signaling pathways and other biological phenomena interconnect in ways that allow adaptation to new circumstances. This adaptability can be exploited to solve real-world problems in industry, agriculture, and medicine. Synthetic biology brings together biology, biotechnology, computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics to create useful genetic tools and platforms. It is also a strategy to help us understand basic biological regulatory mechanisms and complex genetic networks: by designing and building artificial ones, we learn how they work in nature (understanding by building). In this course, you will study the theoretical underpinnings of cutting-edge research in synthetic biology and learn how the development of disruptive technologies, combined with engineering principles, led to the emergence of this new scientific field. You will also learn how basic theory and knowledge of biology can guide the rational design of artificial biological circuits in living cells to accomplish well-defined goals. The goal of the course is to help you acquire essential techniques in synthetic biology, such as designing and constructing genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems, and develop new perspectives and skills that may help you in the future meet the demands of the biotech industry and academia."}, "COURSE_FLAGS": [], "SECT": {"L1(1065)": {"Date_N_Time": ["We 03:00PM - 05:50PM"], "Room": ["G002, CYT Bldg (30)"], "Instructor": [["LAI, Yong"]], "Wait": "0", "Remarks": {"consent": false}, "QEA": {"OPEN": {"Quota": 30, "Enrol": 0, "Avail": 30}}}}, "_SECTIONS_keyfield": "Section"}, "BIEN6990": {"COURSE_INFO": {"PREVIOUS CODE": "BIEN 699", "DESCRIPTION": "Master's thesis research supervised by a faculty member.

However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming."}, "COURSE_FLAGS": [], "SECT": {"L1(2250)": {"Date_N_Time": ["MoWe 09:00AM - 10:20AM"], "Room": ["G002, CYT Bldg (30)"], "Instructor": [["PEREZ PALOMAR, Daniel"]], "Wait": "0", "Remarks": {"consent": false}, "QEA": {"OPEN": {"Quota": 15, "Enrol": 2, "Avail": 13}}}}, "_SECTIONS_keyfield": "Section"}, "ELEC3200": {"COURSE_INFO": {"PRE-REQUISITE": "(ELEC 2100 OR ELEC 2100H) AND [MATH 2350 OR (MATH 2111 AND MATH 2351)]", "EXCLUSION": "CENG 3110, MECH 3610", "DESCRIPTION": "This course introduces basic concepts, tools and techniques for modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems.

However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it.
